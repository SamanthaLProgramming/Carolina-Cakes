## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Prior to beginning the programming phase, I established the site's layout and organized the HTML in a semantic manner using Figma. I then proceeded to enhance each section by applying CSS to elements that needed styling. By structuring the entire site and planning the HTML layout in advance, I found that the project progressed more seamlessly during the development process.

## Optimizations
Transform the gallery into a dynamic photo slider that allows users to click on a specific category, such as Cakes, Cupcakes, or Cookies, and instantly see corresponding images of the chosen item.

## Lessons Learned:

The realization of the amount of consideration required before coding a project was eye-opening. Additionally, starting with a mobile-first approach would have been advantageous, as I encountered several difficulties in adapting the layout to smaller screens.
